Many real world computing problems can be reified through graphs. Prevalence of such trend and scale of these graph related problems have paved the way of different frameworks that accredit parallel and efficient processing. Nature of some computing related to graphs asks for the facility of graph transformations such as K-cluster algorithm. Parallely running graph computation that allows mutation of the same graph can create conflict and result in erroneous or non-deterministic graph. This work tackles the challenge of applying a static type based system to detect possibility of conflicts in concurrent graph mutations such as dangling edges. The main problem is that if the computation involved in such mutations depend dynamically on some values then the type and dependency of mutations can not be known statically. Our dynamic semantics solves these problems. The basic idea is our hybrid system identifies the dependency of variables/vertices trailing the other variables the former is dependent upon. The straightforward assumption is that two variables having same set of dependencies denote the same value. We have worked on a prototype hybrid type cheker to verify the soundness of the approach.
