\section{Meta-theory}
\label{sec:soundness}

This section proves the formal properties of Y. % Here, Y is the name of your calculus.
We first show the standard soundness property. 
Next, we prove P1. Then, we prove P2. % Here, P1 and P2 are properties specific to your calculus.

{\bf TODO: present theorem and prove soundness. Present theorems and prove P1 and P2}
